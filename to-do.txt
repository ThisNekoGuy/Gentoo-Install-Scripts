To-do list:
-----------

- Test the script on actual hardware for bug testing (help wanted)
- Add a system timer that waits 24 hours before permitting "emerge --sync" to run again; to avoid being banned by Gentoo.org on suspicion of DDoS-ing (help wanted)
- Add error handling for the entire script; preferably in a way that handles anything inside of the chroot function with a message of where the error was and a redirect to the repo's issue page (help wanted)
- Split the install-script into smaller functions and sub-scripts (help wanted)
- Figure out how to regenerate an initramfs on every kernel upgrade for sys-kernel/gentoo-sources (the Wiki references this but doesn't clearly tell how: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Distribution_Kernel#Trying_it_out - it claims to be in the handbook but isn't) (help wanted)
- Set a template "USE"-like variable for all build profiles, and replace ${USE_FLAGS} references with the template variable; this can later have a user script that allows to more easily change the template USE values without deleting important values for unique build profiles by blanket-setting USE, itself, recklessly (help wanted)
- Add support for downloading aarch64 stage3 tarballs (help wanted)
- Add support for selecting systemd as a user option; requires conditionals for existing OpenRC commands (not many changes), downloading systemd stage3 tarballs, and profile selection
- Replace Nvidia Bumblebee with Nvidia Optimus (help definitely wanted)
