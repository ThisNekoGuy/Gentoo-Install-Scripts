To-do list:
-----------

- Test the script on actual hardware for bug testing
- Add error handling for the entire script; preferably in a way that handles anything inside of the chroot function with a message of where the error was and a redirect to the repo's issue page
- Add an unattended feature for the script, for those who don't want the interactive experience
